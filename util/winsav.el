;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library was orignally written to solve the problem of adding a
;; window to the left of some windows in a frame (but see below for
;; saving and restoring frame, window, files and buffer configurations
;; with named configurations and between sessions).
;;
;; ___________
;; |    |    |
;; | 1  | 2  |
;; |____|____|
;; |         |
;; |    3    |
;; |_________|
;;
;; so that the window structure on the frame becomes
;;
;; ___________
;; |  |  |   |
;; |  | 1| 2 |
;; | B|__|___|
;; | A|      |
;; | R|  3   |
;; |__|______|
;;
;;
;; This problem can be solved by this library.  However the solution in
;; this library is a bit more general: You first copy the window
;; structure and then restore that into another window.  To do the
;; above you first copy the window structure in the first frame above
;; with `winsav-get-window-tree'.  Then you create windows like this:
;;
;; ___________
;; |  |      |
;; |  |      |
;; | B|      |
;; | A|      |
;; | R|      |
;; |__|______|
;;
;;
;; Finally you use `winsav-put-window-tree' to put the window
;; structure into the right window.  (Of course you could have put BAR
;; above, under etc.)
;;
;;
;; You can use this library to restore frame configuration when you
;; start Emacs.  To do that you can put this at the end of your
;; .emacs:
;;
;;   (desktop-save-mode 1)
;;   (winsav-save-mode 1)
;;
;; If you want to avoid saving when you exit just turn off these minor
;; modes.
;;
;; You can also save configurations that you later switch between.  As
;; above desktop will take care of the buffers.  For more information
;; see the function
;;
;;   `winsav-switch-config'
;;
;; For information about what is saved and restored and how to
;; customize that see the function `winsav-save-configuration'.
;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Bugs and limitations:
;;
;; Juanma Barranquero has pointed out there is a serious limitation in
;; this way of doing it when overlays with 'window properties are
;; used.  The problem is that any pointers to windows are made invalid
;; since they are deleted.  So in fact any code that relies on saved
;; pointers to windows will have problem if the window is one of those
;; that are involved here.
;;
;; To overcome this problem when doing something like inserting a BAR
;; window (see above) a new window has to be inserted in the existing
;; window tree on a frame in a way that is currently not supported in
;; Emacs.
;;
;; It would be nice to be have primitives to manipulate the window
;; tree more generally from elisp.  That requires implementation of
;; them at the C level of course.
;;
;; However it is probably much easier to implement it quite a bit less
;; general.  The concept of splitting is maybe then the right level to
;; search for primitives at.
;;
;; My conclusion is that it will take some time to find suitable
;; primitives for this.
;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;;; Change log:
;;
;; Version 0.72:
;;
;; - Format of window structure changed in Emacs 23. Adopted to that.
;; - Added save and restore of frame/window configurations between
;;   Emacs sessions.
;; - Added named winsav configurations for save and restore of frames,
;;   windows, buffers and files.
;;
;; Version 0.71:
;;
;; - Added rotation of window structure.
;;
;; Version 0.70:
;;
;; - Support for save and restore from file.
